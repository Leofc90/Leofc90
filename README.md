# Hi,Leandro here 👋!

## About Me

I'm a passionate, creative, and perceptive engineer ⚙️ with a hands-on approach to problem-solving and an unending thirst for knowledge 📚. 

Currently, I'm based in London where I work as an Design Manager at Osprey Charging Network, managing all the design aspect of the projects. 
I hold an Beng in Mechanical engineering and I have recently completed an intensive Data Science bootcamp at La Wagon.

When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, you can find me following or doing some sports. Also, I love reading a good book📖 and listening to music 🎶.

I'm always open to new ideas and opportunities. You can learn more about me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leandroflorescabello/) 👥. Feel free to reach out to me directly at leandroflorescabello@gmail.com 📧. Let's connect and explore exciting possibilities together! 🚀
